## Overview
This is just another react universal boilerplate, but I've been searched so many resources to implement this boilerplate. I need single server (uniersal) my own way. 

To make this act application scalable, organized, and easy to understand both client and server side (in my opinion) especially with redux and async

This is my be the worst practice, it's make sense for beginner though. (hopefully)
